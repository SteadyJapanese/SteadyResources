## Anime

Anime is a great source of immersion material as well as sentences for mining. Slice of life anime are especially good for beginners as they often use simple vocabulary and typically have fun, light-hearted stories that are easy to follow.
That being said, the thing that makes anime so great is that there are so many different shows about so many different things that there's something for nearly everyone.

Download anime:
- [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/): a torrent site that has many copies of a lot of anime, although the older and more obscure ones might not have any seeders. You can find anything from low quality to incredibly high quality rips on here, so it's worth looking around.
- [HorribleSubs](https://horriblesubs.info/): a fansub group that releases high quality rips quite soon after the episodes air (obviously turn off the subtitles). They have both torrent and direct download options. You can usually find most of their torrents on Nyaa as well, including batch downloads for entire seasons of shows.
- [anisource](https://asnet.pw/): an aggregate site for high quality raws from Raws-4U, スカー Raws and Leopard-Raws
- [AnimeOut](https://www.animeout.xyz/): free downloads of lots of anime, with batch links as well, although some old encodings may have hardcoded English subs
- [B9GOOD](http://b9good.com/): stream recently aired anime, also had download links

Stream anime:
- [**disgusting weeb**](http://dsgstng.com/): Streams live tv of anime, when there is no anime airing, they just play normal tv
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com): a subscription-based, on-demand streaming service that has a good selection of anime to watch, depending on where you live. If you want to get access to A LOT more anime on netflix than you normally can, you can [use a VPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKroCjsD6xg) to trick Netflix into thinking you're in Japan.
- [Daiweeb - Terakoya](https://www.daiweeb.org/terakoya): a free streaming site that has a good selection of anime with japanese subtitles, however you can't turn off the subtitles entirely which is kind of annoying.
- [Animelon](https://animelon.com/): a free streaming site that has a good selection of anime with the added bonus of having japanese subtitles, however the subtitles can be buggy sometimes.
- [anjsub](https://www.anjsub.com/): A free streaming site that has decent list of anime with japanese subtitles. There is also an interactive transcript next to the videos so you can skip around to certain lines whenever you want.
- [B9GOOD](http://b9good.com/): stream recently aired anime, also had download links

## Subtitles

- [Xavier's Retimed JP Sub Pack v01 (425 Tiles)](https://forum.koohii.com/thread-15129.html): 1.4GB of subtitles, re-timed to specific releases, so you know they're accurate as long as you download the correct release
- [kitsunekko](http://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F): The most comprehensive source of Japanese subtitles that I know of. You won't find every anime here, but a lot of popular stuff is here, albeit you may need to re-time the subs depending on which release you downloaded. WARNING: Don't use the link on the homepage to download all japanese subs, as there may be malicious files in some of the directories, for example "Ore no imouto ga konnani kawaii" contains a virus. I think this is because the uploads are not strictly moderated by anyone.
- [Subadub - Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subadub/jamiekdimmhnnemaaimmdahnahfmfdfk)
- [Subadub - Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subadub/): A browser addon that allows downloading of subtitles straight from Netflix as well as enhances netflix subtitles (allows copying and pasting, among other things). Made by symstym from the discord server.

- [D-Addicts - Subtitle Forum](https://www.d-addicts.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=13): Drama subtitles. Requires you to make a free forum account.
- [jpsubbers drama subtitles](http://jpsubbers.web44.net/Japanese-Subtitles/): Index of a decent amount of drama subtitles. Click the directories that start with an `@` symbol and you can find folders sorted by year and season.
- [Dramanote](http://www.dramanote.com/): not subtitles, but drama scripts, which you could still use for sentence mining
- [JRPG scripts](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/54haix/a_dump_of_jrpg_japanese_scripts/): scripts from a bunch of JRPGs, mainly Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest
- [**Netflix jp subs**](https://mega.nz/#F!Yo8FhQBJ!Uoj0GbjA1RyiANp7NjHeVg)
- [**Subs for dramas**](http://jpsubbers.web44.net/Japanese-Subtitles/): Subtitles for drama

- [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/0B4SicD-zZ_Z1SWtNWjlfMmJtRFE): Google drive folder full of drama. I think these are recorded straight from TV, so the file sizes are quite large relative to their length. Some of the files are password protected, ask in the Discord server if you want the password.
- [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/): Not as good for dramas as it is for anime and manga, but you can still find some dramas on there

## TV Shows
- [ForJoyTV](https://forjoytv.com/): Streaming service that allows you to watch I think any japanese TV channel (formerly known as FujiTVLive). You can make a free account and try it out for a day (or keep making free accounts every single day), otherwise you can buy subscriptions for varying amounts of time. Great value for money and you get access to pretty much every Japanese TV channel.
- [AvistaZ](https://avistaz.to): Private torrent tracker with a wide selection of asian media. Lots of hard to find movies and TV shows in good quality most of the time.

For a list of audiobooks in the folder that also have books in the DJT library, click [here](https://gist.github.com/askoufis/e67e637918e5b16d6f4a4da6b0bbe74d#file-resources-djt-audiobooks-md).
- [Audible](audible.co.jp): The Japanese version of Amazon's Audible service. Huge selection of audiobooks, but soon they're moving away from the model where you pay for access to everything, instead you'll get credits every month to use, as well as discounts on other audiobooks
- [Quicksleur](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dXh9ntPVLORVKHaHzlnRSvNmBCUIszvh): Pimsleur's Japanese lessons with less silence, saving ~10 minutes per lesson, edited by Lucas from the discord. After you listen to the Quicksleur lesson, you should then move on to Trimsleur for immersion.

- [Library Genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=japanese&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=0&column=language): Contains many nonfiction books or various topics. the search function is mostly broken, so you need to simply search "japanese", make the category "language" and then scroll through the 40 pages to find whatever you want. Most of the files are PDFs though, not ebook formats, although you could try converting them if you want. Downloads can be quite slow sometimes, but if you put the download link into [Jdownloader](#tools) it can speed up the downloads a lot.
- [Aozora Bunko 青空文庫](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/): A free library of thousands of public-domain and free books. All their books are actually in a specific format that is just plain text (i.e. .txt files) that can be read by aozora bunko readers.

The link said 4000 but the download says 3000 so I don't know how many there are. There's a booklist [here](goo.gl/rgzz5a).
- [Convert Aozora Bunko to MOBI](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1n0b3f/convert_aozora_bunko_books_to_kindle_paperwhite/): follow this guide to convert Aozora Bunko format books into MOBI so you can put them on a kindle (or use [calibre](#tools) to convert them to something else)

- [**anime-sharing**](http://www.anime-sharing.com/forum/): This is a website filled with visual novels (and other media) in Japanese to download. Not all of the links to download them work, but plenty do, and it's worth giving a shot. Some links are NSFW
- [**The asenheim project**](https://tss.asenheim.org/): here you can read some classic visual novels online. You can use Yomichan/Rikaikun to look up words and copy sentences from the text log and paste them into anki.


## Dictionaries

The ability to quickly look up an accurate and informative definition of a word is incredibly valuable, however it should not be a replacement for immersion, as you cannot intuitively acquire the meaning of a word solely through reading its definition.
That being said, having access to multiple different dictionaries is still very useful. While physical are nice and all, there are some great online and digital dictionaries out there.

Online dictionaries:
- [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/): a great English/Japanese online dictionary that has many [search options](https://jisho.org/docs) and also the ability to search by drawing or combining radicals. A great dictionary for bilingual definitions, however it's definitely not as good as a real Japanese dictionary.
- [Weblio](https://www.weblio.jp/): an online Japanese dictionary that searches daijirin (so it has pitch accent), wiktionary and other dictionaries
- [Sanseido web dictionary](https://www.sanseido.biz/)
- [Goo](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/)

Digital dictionaries:
- [Qolibri](https://osdn.net/projects/qolibri/releases/29711): EPWING viewing software. No longer being developed, but it still works fine on modern systems
- [Qolibri dark theme](http://www.mediafire.com/file/h0s638ka3wa0re9/article-style.css): A nicer, less blinding style for qolibri. Grey text on a black (really it's dark grey) background. Unfortunately the whole UI can't be made in this style, and some symbols are still black, but it's better than nothing. Load it up by editing the dictionary style sheet (the button that says .css on it) and selecting the file.
- [GoldenDict](https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict/wiki/Early-Access-Builds-for-Windows): in-development software for reading many different types of dictionry files, including EPWINGS
- [GoldenDict dark theme](http://www.mediafire.com/file/h0s638ka3wa0re9/article-style.css): Copy this file into your C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\GoldenDict folder. It's easy to customize it as well, there's comments in there telling you what each section is for.
- [Main EPWINGs](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ldyklp3362pgg/Japanese_Dictionaries): A selection of the most useful EPWINGs. This, as well as the NHK EPWING are recommended for everyone.
- [NHK pitch accent dictionary EPWING](http://www.mediafire.com/file/sxmpse8n92c9oxg/NHKACT.zip): very useful EPWING with pitch accent information as well as recordings of words and sometimes entire sentences
- [Shinmeikai EPWING with pitch accent](http://www.mediafire.com/file/q9b95d1ad9wnjxd/Shinmeikai.7z): some versions of the shinmeikai EPWING don't have pitch accent information even though they should, this one does
- [Lots of EPWINGs](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=AC31052BF2B8CA11%211937&cid=AC31052BF2B8CA11): A large amount of EPWINGs, some of which won't be be very useful for most people, e.g. the 医歯薬医学大辞書 which is full of medical terms. There's overlap between this and the Main EPWINGs link.
- [Kindle version of daijirin](https://mega.nz/#!34ABBJRI!v2ZYwi14QDg7gKGOZ6l_Ygv4Q7Zn8EOlNVdK-wVvkj8): A kindle version of the daijirin dictionary made using [epwing2kindle](https://github.com/olety/epwing2kindle). Useful since the Japanese dictionary that comes with the Kindle doesn't have pitch accent information, but daijirin does.

## Sentences

- [Yourei](http://yourei.jp/): search for sentences from native media (books I think?)
- [The green sentence site](http://nlt.tsukuba.lagoinst.info/search/): Search for words and then filter sentences by other parts of speech that appear with that word. Sources sentences from somewhere different to the blue site, but otherwise functions the same.
- [The blue sentence site](http://nlb.ninjal.ac.jp/search/): Search for words and then filter sentences by other parts of speech that appear with that word. Sources sentences from somewhere different to the green site, but otherwise functions the same.

- [Wadoku](https://www.wadoku.de/): Japanese/German dictionary that has pitch accent
- [Weblio](https://www.weblio.jp/): an online Japanese dictionary that searches daijirin (so it has pitch accent), wiktionary and other dictionaries
- [NHK Pitch Accent Dictionary - Scan](http://www.mediafire.com/file/tsrs58rg61y8x3d/NHK%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E7%99%BA%E9%9F%B3%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E6%96%B0%E8%BE%9E%E5%85%B8%E3%83%BB%E4%BB%98%E9%8C%B2.pdf): scan of the NHK Pitch Accent dictionary, specifically the sections at the back (which aren't in the EPWING) that explain the theory, rules and patterns
- [新明解 Pitch Accent Dictionary 2nd Ed - Scan](http://www.mediafire.com/file/mwzighd9dnvo63w/%E6%96%B0%E6%98%8E%E8%A7%A3%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E8%BE%9E%E5%85%B8+%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88%E3%83%BB%E4%BB%98%E9%8C%B2.pdf): scan of the Shinmeikai Pitch Accent dictionary, specifically the sections at the back that explain the theory, rules and patterns.

- [OJAD Recordings](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/): Pitch accent and audio recordings (not for everything) of a lot of words from different lessons from a bunch of textbooks. While it's not worth going through the lessons for each textbook, it has a search engine that's pretty useful.
- [OJAD](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/phrasing): generate text-to-speech sentences with somewhat accurate pitch accent (don't assume it's correct)


## Tools
- [subs2srs](http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/): Takes video files and subtitle files and cards with screenshots and/or audio for each line in the sub file. Also useful for batch extracting audio from videos.

- [JGlossator](http://jglossator.sourceforge.net/): a complicated piece of software that I don't know much about but apparently it does some cool stuff, but it's probably more worthwhile immersing than figuring out what it does and how to use it
- [Free iOS VPN](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/vpn%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B3-%E6%B0%B8%E4%B9%85%E3%81%AE%E7%84%A1%E6%96%99-%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E7%84%A1%E5%88%B6%E9%99%90-%E7%B0%A1%E5%8D%98%E3%81%AB%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%82%B9/id1134784923?mt=8)

## Miscellaneous Links

- [Kanji stroke order font](http://www.nihilist.org.uk/): handwritten font with built in stroke order numbers
- [Kanji stroke order colored SVGs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_93Um-T7q7-jBZRgG5MGvjLWhmhwVDD/view): Coloured vector graphics files (SVGs) that contain stroke order numbers. The above font is actually based off the SVG data that these files are made from. I prefer these over the stroke order font because they look pretty and they have simplified versions of the kanji that have them (they have `-Hyougai` in the filename), which are the ones taught in RTK and the ones you should learn.

## Android apps
Here is a bunch of android manga applications, each one gives you at least one free issue a day. A number if the apps have content overlaps, so you could use them to continue reading a single story when you finish your daily allotment of points for one app, or you could read stuff separately and do one story a day of a particular series in order to develop a daily reading habit . **You need JAPANESE google play account for the download**.
